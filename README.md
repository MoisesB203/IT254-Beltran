# IT254-Beltran
IT 254 Project Repo
We are planning to create a smart monitor system for plants. The system will monitor watering for the plant and let the user know when it's time to rewater the plant. The system will used leds and alarms to let the user know when it is time to water the plant again. We will use ai to monitor the plant and the best watering pattern for it. The project would only need an arduino, some leds, a buzzer, and a soil sensor to monitor.
