IT 254 Project Repo- AI Dog Recognition 

In our project we trained an AI model to detect a certain dog. Once the dog was recoginized it would update the message on the screen to welcome the corresponding dog. 
For our project we used a Google Teachable model and trained it on pictures of my dog. Originally the project was supposed to be more complex but due to limited time and small group size we had to scale down our project. Some issues i came across was with the AI model used. It had a hard time distinguishing the other dogs from each other. It was functional enough but if I were to do it again I would change the model used

## Items Used
